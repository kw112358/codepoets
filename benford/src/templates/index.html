 <h1 style="text-align: center">Benford's Law</h1>
 <p style="text-align: center">In 1938, Frank Benford published a paper showing
  the distribution of the leading digit in many disparate sources of data.
  In all these sets of data, the number 1 was the leading digit about 30% of the time.
  Benfordâ€™s law has been found to apply to population numbers, death rates, lengths of rivers,
  mathematical distributions given by some power law, and physical constants like atomic weights
  and specific heats.</p>
